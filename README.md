# Process Memory Search Program

This program allows you to search for specific strings within the memory of a running process. To use it, you just need to provide the Process ID (PID) of the target process and the path to a file containing the strings you want to search for.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher.
- Necessary permissions to read the memory of other processes.
- Ensure the target process is accessible and you have the right permissions to read its memory.
